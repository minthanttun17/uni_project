      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <li>
        One of the fundamental elements of an electrical engineer is knowing
        about the different types of electric motors. There are two types of
        electric motors. They are <span>DC(direct current) </span>&
        <span>AC(alternating current)</span> electric motors. From this project
        I could expand my knowledge about the inner workings of electric motors
        and so much more.
      </li>
      <li>
        We rewinded a three phase DC motor and I will explain some information.
        (This was a group project)
      </li>
      <li>
        The physical project is kept by my University and I can't show it so I
        uses my project report book to make this.

      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Taking Data</span>
          <p>
            It is important that the mortor produces the same performance
            characterist-ics(eg.horsepower or kilowatt rating and speed) as
            prior to rewind and that the energy effiency ating is maintained.
            Moreover, it si also important to note that some of the critical
            data can't be detetmined later in the winding process.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Coil Cutoff</span>
          <p>
            It is important to be able to cut off coil extenisons without injury
            to the stator. The idea is to cut the copper wire, not any other
            metal part of the stator. Proper cutting of the coil extensions also
            reduces time and effort when pulling the coils out.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Winding Stripping</span>
          <p>
            We used winding removal methods and equipments to remove the old
            winding safely and avoiding damage to the stator core. Closely
            associated with Winding Stripping is Taking Data, as much of the
            imortant data is obtained during the stripping process such as
            connection, turns, spans, poles and grouping.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Coe Perparation</span>
          Key objectives in Core Preparation are ow to clean, inspect and
          prepare the bare core and how to repair lamination damage and defects.
          This step assures that the core is in satisfactory condition prior to
          actual rewindings and is associated with the Core Testng lesson. The
          prepared core is core tested to verify that core losses have no
          increased from the initial ocre test by an unacceptable amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Coil Making</span>
          This is creating new coil from new magnet wire and othe r material.
          The primary objectives of coil making are recognizing the materials,
          tools and equipment needed and how to make random wound coils to be
          installed into a three-phase stator core.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span> Winding Insulation and Coil Insertion </span>Having made new
          coils we needed to be inserted into the core bringing up the next step
          Winding Insulation and Coil Insertion. This is about to determine the
          material and tools needed and how to instal random wound coils into a
          three-phase stator core.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Internal Connection</span>
          <p>
            Even through the winding coils had been made and inserted correctly,
            the wining would not perform properly if it not connected correctly.
            This is accomplished in the next step, Internal Connections. From
            this step I could learn how to identify and lay out winding
            connectons and the precedures for actually connection the winding.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Varnishing</span>
          <p>
            The inserted winding coils should be sung in the sung in the slots,
            but will need reinforcement to reduce the tendency to move or shift.
            Varnish treatment and curing will do much to make the winding mroe
            rigid; however there is another key step to be used to reinforce
            winding coils. That is Lacing and Bracing of Winding, with the main
            objectives being to make the winder proficient in the methods,
            materials and procedures for lacing bracing of windings
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Testing</span> We tested insulations with testers so that we
          could know if they were suitable resistance or not.
